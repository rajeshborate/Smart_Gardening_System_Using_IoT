The main objective is to provide a comfortable and convenient user interface by sensing and controlling the plant environment. Using Node MCU along with several sensors like soil moisture, Temperature and Humidity sensor were used to actuate water pump and UV light source. Which interact with an android app using Ubidots as a cloud platform. The project successfully completed under the supervision of Experts Hub team, Pune.
Using ESP8266 as the main framework because of ease of compatibility with WiFi, several sensors were used to moniter the current state of garden like soil moisture sensor , temperature and humidity sensor , light intensity sensor and ultrasonic sensor .Additional hardware such as water pump and UV light source were also integrated using relays .Moreover , we also developed and android app that was used to moniter and remotely access the garden from anywhere in the world .Ubidots was used as cloud platform for the system and by using REST APIs , all the data from the embedded hardware was POSTED into the android app .Ubidots also gave additional visualization and graphical representation features to make the app much more interactive .
